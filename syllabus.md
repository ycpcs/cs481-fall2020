### Grading Policy

Your grade will be determined as a weighted average of the grades on the 8 
assignments, as follows:

-   Assignment 0 - Individual Effort, Effectiveness, and Professionalism - **30%**
-   Assignment 1 - Team Project Proposal - **5%**
-   Assignment 2 - Weekly Progress Demonstrations - **10%**
-   Assignment 3 - Requirements - **5%**
-   Assignment 4 - Analysis and Design - **5%**
-   Assignment 5 - Minimal Working System - **10%**
-   Assignment 6 - 50% Working System - **10%**
-   Assignment 7 - Final System, Report, and Presentation - **25%**

**Individual Effort, Effectiveness, and Professionalism**<br>
This portion of the grade will assess a variety of factors over the duration of the 
semester-long project, including: individual level of effort, technical contributions 
and competence, time management, motivation, teamwork, leadership, organization and 
planning, communication skills, contributions to project documentation, and overall 
attitude. The individual effort, technical contributions, and technical competence will 
be determined by the amount and significance of git commits, weekly updates, and peer 
reviews.

Grades will be assigned on a 100-point scale according to the following table:

| Range             |  Grade   |
|:-----------------:|:--------:|
| ≥ 90 and ≤ 100    |   4.0    |
| ≥ 85 and &lt; 90  |   3.5    |
| ≥ 80 and &lt; 85  |   3.0    |
| ≥ 75 and &lt; 80  |   2.5    |
| ≥ 70 and &lt; 75  |   2.0    |
| ≥ 60 and &lt; 70  |   1.0    |
| &lt; 60           |    0     |

### Attendance Policy

Class is scheduled to meet three times per week.  Weekly progress reports are required 
from each student during one of those meeting times.  Attendance at the weekly progress
report is mandatory.  During the other two meeting times, students are expected to meet
with their group to work on their senior design project.

### Academic Integrity

York College's mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to
principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore,
academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic
dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating,
plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc.,
and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others
and claim such work as their own.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic
dishonesty, the faculty member must promptly notify the student in writing
and obtain confirmation of notification from the student.  The faculty
member then has ten business days from that written notification to
the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and
the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic
dishonesty will be kept on file in the student's permanent record. The
faculty member has full discretion to determine a suitable penalty for
the student, up to a course grade of 0.  This discretion is limited to
the course in which the dishonesty took place.  Students may not withdraw
from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty,
unless and until the accusation is withdrawn by the faculty member or
is overturned by the Student Welfare Committee or the Dean of Academic
Affairs.

Students who believe they have been unjustly charged or sanctioned must
discuss the situation with the faculty member and have 10 business
days thereafter to submit an appeal to Student Welfare Committee
through the Dean of Academic Affairs. If an appeal is filed, the
Student Welfare Committee will then conduct a hearing to review the
charge and/or sanction.  In the case of an egregious first offense, the
faculty member may request that the Student Welfare Committee conduct a
hearing and determine a sanction, which may involve academic probation,
suspension or dismissal from the College.

If the Dean of Academic Affairs determines that the academic dishonesty is
the student's second offense, the Dean will provide written notification
to the student, the faculty member, and the Department Chair. The Student
Welfare Committee will automatically conduct a hearing to review the
charge and decide on an appropriate sanction, which will involve academic
probation, suspension or dismissal from the College. Students who believe
the Student Welfare Committee has unjustly sanctioned them may submit
a written appeal to the Dean of Academic Affairs within 72 hours of
receiving notification of the Student Welfare Committee's sanction.

### Personal Technology Policy

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate.  The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.


--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---



### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers.  Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations.  In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking.  Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.

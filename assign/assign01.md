# Tasks

There are three tasks which are part of this assignment.

## Proposal

Your first task is to propose a group project that your team will work on. Your team must choose a project in which you will design and implement a substantial software system.

Write a 1 to 2 page report describing the project. The report should include the following information:

-   Who are the members of your group? Your group should have at least 3 members, but not more than 4.
-   What is the URL of the main repository for your project?  (See next task.)
-   What problem is solved by the system your group will implement?
-   What are the major technical challenges you will face?
-   What technologies (programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware devices, etc.) will you use in the implementation of the system?
-   What kind of user interface will the system have?

Use diagrams as appropriate to convey this information clearly.

### Please Talk To Your Instructor[s]!

You are **strongly** encouraged to meet with your instructor[s] to discuss project ideas before you submit your formal project proposal.

## Set up a GitHub repository

Your second task is to create a main repository for your project on [GitHub](https://github.com).

You should add all of your team members as contributors to the repository.  Also, add your instructor[s] (GitHub user [dbabcock](https://github.com/dbabcock), [jmoscola](https://github.com/jmoscola)) to the list of contributors.

In the issue tracker for the main repository, create three labels:

-   **Feature (light blue)** - indicates a planned feature to be implemented
-   **Bug (red)** - indicates a problem with code that needs to be addressed
-   **In-progress (green with individual initials)** - one per group member indicating which tasks are currently being worked on.

Your group may add additional labels as desired.

## Set up your computing environment

Your third task is for each group member to set up a computing environment with the hardware and software you will need for the project.

You may use the physical space and computing equipment as you see fit.  Please be considerate of the needs of other groups, and please try to keep the environment neat and well-organized.

Please note that you aren't required to use one of the PCs: you can use your own laptop if you would prefer.

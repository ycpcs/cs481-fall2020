# Your Task


Your task is to create initial analysis and design models which identify the important classes in your system, and their relationships. If your project includes a database, a database schema should be included showing the tables and fields of the database.

Your goal should be to create a **minimal** UML design model that will provide a good framework to build upon. A minimal design model will

- Include all important core data model classes (the classes representing the most important concepts in the problem domain)
- Include *basic* user interface classes for the minimal working system
- Have sufficient methods to adequately describe the behaviors of each class
- Have an architecture which cleanly separates the data model classes from the user interface classes
- Follow design principles (such as the Single Responsibility Principle)

Use [Violet UML](http://alexdp.free.fr/violetumleditor/page.php) to create your model.

If your UML and/or OO modeling skills are rusty, **please see your instructor[s]**.  The ability to create a model of a system is hugely important, and potential employers are likely to ask OO modeling questions in job interviews.

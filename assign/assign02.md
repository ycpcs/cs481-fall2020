# Expectations for Weekly Demos

Here is what the instructor[s] would like to see from you for the weekly demos/updates.


## Journal entries (individual)

Each team member should have a **SINGLE** issue in the group's issue tracker dedicated to documenting that team member's
progress.  Each week, each team member should add at least one comment to this "issue" to document his or her work for the week.
  
Each weekly journal entry should also contain a list of the following:

* Links to issues that were created/opened by you 
* Links to issues that were closed by you
* Links to each commit made by you

Please format your entry as a *bulleted list*.

You can create a link to a commit by pasting the first 8 (or so) hex digits of its hash code.

Your journal entries should be complete by midnight on Tuesday (so they can be reviewed by the instructor[s] on Wednesday morning.)


## Demo (individual)

Each class meeting, an instructor will talk to each student *individually*. Your job is to very briefly (1-2 minutes) demonstrate what you worked on during the previous week, and how your efforts are contributing to the overall success of the project. For that demo, you should pick perhaps two or three of your most important contributions (as documented in your journal entry for the previous week).

Ways that you can demonstrate progress include

* **Requirements, analysis, and design artifacts**: During the early stages of the project, documenting requirements, modeling the problem domain, and developing a system design to meet the requirements are very important in order to create a solid foundation for your system.  In addition, as you iterate later in the semester, it is useful to update parts of the requirements and analysis/design models in order to support further progress towards meeting the system requirements.
* **Working, tested, integrated code**: Assuming that your group has a solid design, this is generally the most important type of contribution.
* **Prototype code**: A standalone proof-of-concept demo is fine, especially in the early stages of the project.  However, all such work needs to be integrated into the main codebase in a timely manner.
* **Equipment/apparatus**: If your project has external equipment or apparatus, then you can show us progress on its construction and setup.  However, time spent on equipment/apparatus should be the mininum necessary to support the needs of the software you are creating.

# Team meeting

In addition to the individual meetings, overall project progress will be discussed in a brief meeting with the whole team.

# Evaluation

For each weekly demo, you (individually) will receive one of the following evaluations:

* **Exceeds expectations**: You are making an extraordinary contribution to your project, and that overall, your team is on course to have a very strong final progress.
* **Meets expectations**: You are making an adequate contribution to your project, and that your team is on track for a solid (but perhaps not exceptional) final product.
* **Below expectations**: You are not making a sufficient contribution to your team's project, and that your team's final product will not meet the minimum expectations.
